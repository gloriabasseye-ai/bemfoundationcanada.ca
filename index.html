        <article class="card">
          <h3>Youth Mentorship</h3>
          <p>
            We walk alongside young people as they figure out school, friendships, and their future. 
            Through one-on-one mentoring, life-skills workshops, and peer support circles, youth gain 
            confidence, build positive habits, and learn real-world skills like job prep and money 
            management. Our mentors are also trained to support youth who have faced difficult 
            experiences, including exploitation or trafficking.
          </p>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Family Support</h3>
          <p>
            Raising a family in Canada can be overwhelming. We offer parenting workshops, help families 
            access affordable child care, and host family days where parents can meet trusted child care 
            providers and community workers. We also provide safe, confidential support for families 
            welcoming back loved ones who have survived exploitation or trafficking.

        <article class="card">
          <h3>RESET Initiative</h3>
          <p>
            Everyone deserves a second chance. RESET supports youth who have had involvement with the 
            justice system, offering weekly coaching, job readiness training, and positive opportunities 
            to build resilience. We focus on giving young people the tools to move forward with dignity 
            and purpose.

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Settlement Support</h3>
          <p>
            Starting over in a new country is never easy. Our settlement program helps newcomers understand 
            Canadian systems, practice their English, and connect with housing, jobs, and community resources. 
            We also provide specialized support for newcomer survivors of trafficking, ensuring safety, belonging, 
            and a fresh start.
